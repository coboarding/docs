- You understand and live the principles of extreme programming.
- You see pair programming as a way to share your knowledge and to learn from your peers.
- Your development workflow starts with writing a test (spoiler: you know how to practice test-driven development). 
- You don't get a heart attack if you work in an environment where people are doing trunk-based development and don't waste time merging pull requests and sort out the merge conflict hell afterwards.

- You know what the test pyramid is and that aiming for 100% code coverage does not make sense. 
- Clean code is not only a buzz word for you and you know how important it is to rely on automated tests to be able to constantly refactor and develop a robust product platform.
- You integrate your changes multiple times per day and you know how to use feature toggles.
- Programming languages are a tool for you to achieve a goal. And they might change over time. You can find our current tech stack here. 
- You live the principle of constant learning and adapting to new technologies, tools and market situations.
